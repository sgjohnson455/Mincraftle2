# Mincraftle2

This project is an attempt to create an updated version of the Mincraftle Game. Minecraftle is the mincraft version of wordle. This project will be an attempt to add the updated new recipies and crafting items from minecraft, which the current Minecraftle game does not have.

Main complaints
- weird sound design choice (needs to be more consistent)
- more ingredients
- more tries
- can't put down ingredients (can only swap)
- highlights the arrow (when dragging an ingredient)
- should have the newest at the top, not the bottom
- need more recipies

Design Notes
- EXCLUDE single item recipies
- Need way of tossing objects into the void (or like a creative mode delete)
- Specify colorblind friendly mode

Additions: 
- could have a easy/medium/hard mode which just increases the number of available ingredients
